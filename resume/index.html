<h3 id="selected-data-science-projects">SELECTED DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS</h3>
<p><strong>The All Convolutional Net.</strong>  Tools Used: Python, Theano, Lasagne, Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Numpy, AWS EC2 Elastic GPU</p>
<p>Implemented the All Convolutional Net deep learning architecture in Theano and Lasagne; recreated the results in the paper. Confirmed thesis in the paper that a pooling layer can be replaced by increasing the stride in the convolutional layers to obtain a similar accuracy in classifying cyphar10 and cyphar100 datasets.</p>
<p><strong>Artist Recommender System Using Python and Apache Spark.</strong>  Tools Used: PySpark, MlLib, Python, AWS EMR
Built a recommender system in PySpark using the Alternating Least Square Matrix Factorization algorithm to model listening behavior of users and recommend new artists based on implicit feedback inferred.</p>
<p><strong>Relaxation Response (RR) Induced Expression Changes to Genes Associated with Diabetes, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Obesity.</strong> Tools Used: R,</p>
<p>Machine learning research on expression data of genes that are linked to Diabetes, Alzheimers and Obesity to discover those with statistically significant association to relaxation response activities. Trained Elastic Net and PCA models in R to classify among control group, long-term and short-term practitioners of RR activities. Discovered a number of genes most associated with immunity, that were significantly elevated in long-term and short-term practitioners as opposed to the control group.</p>
<p><strong>Employee Tenure Machine Learning Challenge..</strong> Tools Used: Python, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Jupyter</p>
<p>A modeling, and data exploration challenge on real world data for an HR consulting company to analyze and make make predictions of employee&rsquo;s tenure length. Developed using Python, an analytics codebase to perform exploratory analysis, feature engineering and parameter tuning and choose the model with the highest cross validation score after selecting the best hyper-parameter settings for each model.</p>

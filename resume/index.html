<p><strong>The All Convolutional Net.</strong>  Tools Used: <em>Python, Theano, Lasagne, Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Numpy, AWS EC2 Elastic GPU</em></p>
<p>Implemented the All Convolutional Net, a deep learning architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers. Used the Theano and Lasagne deep learning frameworks; reproduced the results and confirmed the thesis of the paper that max-pooling can be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. <a href="https://github.com/EHDEV/relaxation_response">Link</a></p>
<p><strong>Artist Recommender System Using Python and Apache Spark.</strong>  Tools Used: <em>PySpark, MlLib, Python, AWS EMR</em></p>
<p>Built a recommender system in PySpark using the Alternating Least Square Matrix Factorization algorithm to model listening behavior of users and recommend new artists based on implicit feedback inferred. <a href="https://github.com/EHDEV/spark_music">Link</a></p>
<p><strong>Relaxation Response (RR) Induced Expression Changes to Genes Associated with Diabetes, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Obesity.</strong> Tools Used: <em>R</em></p>
<p>Machine learning research on gene expression data of genes that are linked to Diabetes, Alzheimers and Obesity. The aim was to find any set of genes with a statistically significant association to relaxation response activities (yoga, meditation, regular prayers, etc). Trained a Logistic Regression model with L1 &amp; L2 regularization, using a dimensionally reduced gene expression samples to classify among control group, long-term and short-term practitioners of RR activities. Discovered a set of genes linked to the immune system that were significantly elevated in long-term and short-term practitioners of RR as opposed to the control group. <a href="https://github.com/EHDEV/relaxation_response">Link</a></p>
<p><strong>Data Lake and Analytics Platform.</strong> Tools Used: <em>Snowflake, Python, Apache Airflow, AWS Redshift, S3, SQS, Apache Spark</em></p>
<p>A cloud data warehouse along with a collection of high performance data pipelines built to ingest data from disparate sources such as Facebook, Adobe, Google AdManager, YouTube, and other to load into the enterprise data lake and warehouse, transform and make available for analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Employee Tenure ML Challenge.</strong> Tools Used: <em>Python, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Jupyter Notebook</em></p>
<p>A modeling, and data exploration challenge on real world data for an HR consulting company to analyze and predict the tenure length of employees. <a href="https://github.com/EHDEV/employee_tenure_modeling">Link</a></p>

<p>I started my tech career in Ethiopia when I was hired as a Software Test Engineer at a startup in Addis Ababa. A year later I moved to the US to continue my education in software engineering. I completed my bachelors in Information Systems from CUNY Baruch and began working as a data warehouse / production support engineer at a Fintech startup, OnDeck Capital. Later, I worked as a data engineer, in a senior capacity at a number of companies in tech, media and finance industries.</p>
<p>I am currently working on starting up a company called Elite Data Labs, that builds AI applications, consults and trains professionals in Machine Learning and Data Engineering.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m also working on a text analytics SaaS platform that identifies the sentiment, topic, intent, etc of text; extract features from text; and segments text into different clusters via an API and web interface.</p>
<p>So far, I have built and delivered a number of AI, data warehousing and data engineering projects in my previous roles as a data and analytics engineer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead prospect prediction api using Python Flask, FastAI and Pytorch</li>
<li>Topic classification model for VICE Media news articles using Python, Keras and Python Flask</li>
<li>A data Warehouse and ETL Pipelines for a media company using Snowflake, S3, AWS Redshift and Apache Airflow</li>
